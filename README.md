## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying various image processing techniques, including enhancement, compression, and segmentation, to improve image quality and analyze image features effectively.

---

## Techniques Used

### Image Enhancement
1. **Power Law Transformation (Gamma Correction)**
   - Description: Adjusts the intensity of the image based on a power-law relationship. Useful for correcting underexposed or overexposed images.
   - Formula:
     \[
     s = c \cdot r^\gamma
     \]
     where \( s \) is the output pixel value, \( r \) is the input pixel value, \( c \) is a scaling constant, and \( \gamma \) is the power law exponent.

2. **Grey-Level Slicing**
   - Description: Enhances specific intensity ranges to highlight important features, such as brightening dark regions in the image.

3. **[Other Enhancement Technique Placeholder]**
   - Add additional enhancement techniques used in the project.

### Image Compression
1. **[Compression Technique 1 Placeholder]**
   - Description: Add details about the first compression technique used in the project.

2. **[Compression Technique 2 Placeholder]**
   - Description: Add details about the second compression technique used in the project.

---

### Image Segmentation
1. **[Segmentation Technique 1 Placeholder]**
   - Description: Add details about the first segmentation technique used in the project.

2. **[Segmentation Technique 2 Placeholder]**
   - Description: Add details about the second segmentation technique used in the project.
